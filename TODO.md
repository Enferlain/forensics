- TODO (future ideas)
- Validate generalization on new/unseen image sets: check if clean subjects rank above artifact-heavy outputs.
- Stability checks: repeatability across runs, small perturbations (resize/JPEG/light blur), and weight sensitivity.
- Reduce resolution advantage: normalize detail metrics to a fixed scale or downsample before scoring.
- Add a lightweight “reject rule” for undertrained/merge artifacts using a couple of metric thresholds.
- Use the manually/automatically scored images as a calibration set to tune thresholds and validate rankings.
- Build a small analysis script to merge manual filename scores with metric scores and report mismatches.
- Consider a separate color-quality score if color quality is a requirement (keep subject quality separate).
